$$ F(q) := \sum_{n=0}^\infty r(n)q^n := \frac{f(-q,-q)}{f(-q)} = (q;q^2)_\infty $$

## Combinatorial interpretation of product

- Let $e(n)$ and $o(n)$ respectively count the number of [partitions](../partitions.html#integer_partitions) of $n$ with an even and odd number of distinct, odd parts. Then $r(n) = e(n) - o(n)$.

## [Asymptotic formula](../asymptotics.html)

$ \displaystyle r(n) \sim FORMULA\;HERE $ as $ n\to\infty. $

## Power series expansion

## $q$-series representations

$ \displaystyle F(q) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nq^{n^2}}{(q^2;q^2)_n} $

**Combinatorial interpretations:**
- The term $(-1)^nq^{n^2}/(q^2;q^2)_n$ for each index $n \geq 0$ generates partitions with exactly $n$ distinct, odd parts, with a positive or negative sign if $n$ is even or odd, respectively. This can be seen from the fact that $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + 2n-1 = n^2$ for $n \geq 1$.
