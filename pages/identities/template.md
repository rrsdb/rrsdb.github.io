$$ F(q) := \sum_{n=0}^\infty r(n)q^n := PRODUCT\;REPRESENTATIONS\;HERE $$

## Combinatorial interpretation of product

- $r(n)$ is the number of [partitions](../partitions.html#integer_partitions) of $n$ with CONGRUENCES HERE.

## [Asymptotic formula](../asymptotics.html)

$ \displaystyle r(n) \sim FORMULA\;HERE $ as $ n\to\infty. $

## Power series expansion
