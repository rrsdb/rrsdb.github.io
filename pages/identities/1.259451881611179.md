$$ F(q) := \sum_{n=0}^\infty r(n)q^n := \frac{f(-q,-q^7)}{\psi(-q)} = \frac{1}{(q^{3},q^{4},q^{5}; q^{8})_\infty} $$

## Combinatorial interpretation of product

- $r(n)$ is the number of [partitions](../partitions.html#integer_partitions) of $n$ into parts congruent to 3, 4, or 5 modulo 8.

## [Asymptotic formula](../asymptotics.html)

$ \displaystyle r(n) \sim \frac{e^{\frac{\pi  \sqrt{n}}{2}} \sec \left(\frac{\pi }{8}\right)}{8 \sqrt{2} n^{3/4}}$ as $ n\to\infty. $

## Power series expansion

## $q$-series representations

$ \displaystyle F(q) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{q^{n(n+2)}(-q;q^2)_n}{(q^2;q^2)_n} $

# Common name
- The analytic identity may be called "the second Ramanujan–Slater mod 8 identity".
- The combinatorial identity is called "the second Göllnitz–Gordon identity".

**[Bailey pair](../Bailey_pairs.html) proof:**
> Insert Bailey pair B(2) into the [pod-Bailey lemma](../Bailey_pairs.html#pod_Bailey_lemma), and apply the [triple product identity](../q-series.html#triple_product).

**Combinatorial interpretations:**
- $r(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ where adjacent parts differ by at least $2$, no consecutive even number appear as parts, and no part is less than $3$.

      
**Notes:**
- Appeared (with $q$ replaced by $-q$) in Ramanujan's lost notebook.
- First proved by Slater (34).
- The combinatorial identity first appeared in Göllnitz's 1960 undergraduate thesis.
