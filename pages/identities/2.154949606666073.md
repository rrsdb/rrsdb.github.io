$$ F(q) := \sum_{n=0}^\infty r(n)q^n := \frac{f(-q^3,-q^5)}{\psi(-q)} = \frac{1}{(q^{},q^{4},q^{7}; q^{8})_\infty} $$

## Combinatorial interpretation of product

- $r(n)$ is the number of [partitions](../partitions.html#integer_partitions) of $n$ with parts congruent to 4 or $\pm 1$ modulo 8.

## [Asymptotic formula](../asymptotics.html)

$ \displaystyle r(n) \sim \frac{e^{\frac{\pi  \sqrt{n}}{2}} \csc \left(\frac{\pi }{8}\right)}{8 \sqrt{2} n^{3/4}}$ as $ n\to\infty. $

## Power series expansion

## $q$-series representations

$ \displaystyle F(q) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{q^{n^2}(-q;q^2)_n}{(q^2;q^2)_n} $

**Common name:** 
- Combinatorial identity is called "the first Göllnitz–Gordon identity."
- The analytic identity may be called "the first Ramanujan–Slater mod 8 identity."

**[Bailey pair](../Bailey_pairs.html) proof:**
> Insert B(1) into the [pod-Bailey lemma](../bailey_pairs.html#pod_Bailey_lemma) and apply the [triple product identity](../q-series.html#triple_product).

**Combinatorial interpretations:**
- $r(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ where parts differ by at least $2$, and no consecutive even numbers appear as parts.
- 2nd interpretation here
    
**Notes:**
- Appears in Ramanujan's lost notebook but with $q$ replaced by $-q$.
- First proved analytically by Slater (36).
- The combinatorial identity was discovered by H. Göllnitz in his 1960 undergraduate thesis.
