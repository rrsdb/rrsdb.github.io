		  <h2> Integer partitions </h2>
		</div>
		<p>A <b>partition</b> of an integer \(n\) is a representation of \(n\) as a sum of positive
		   integers where the order of the summands is not taken into account.
		   Each summand is called a <b>part</b> of the partition.
		   Usually, a convention is adopted wherein the parts are
		   written in weakly decreasing (or sometimes weakly increasing) order. For example, the five Partitions
		   of 4 are
		   \[4,\; 3+1,\; 2+2,\; 2+1+1,\; 1+1+1+1.\]
		</p>
		<p>To emphasize that the parts are to be kept separate from each other the five partitions of 4
		  are often written as
		  \[(4),\;(3,1),\; (2,2),\; (2,1,1),\; (1,1,1,1),\]
		  or, if there is no chance of confusion, as
		  \[4,\; 31,\; 22,\; 211,\; 1111,\]
		  or employing superscripts to indicate repetitions:
          \[4,\; 3 1\; ,2^2,\; 2 1^2,\; 1^4.\]

		</p>
		<p>The number of parts in a partition \(\lambda\) is called the <b>length</b>,
		   and may be denoted \(\ell(\lambda)\). The <b>size</b> (or <b>weight</b>) of a partition
	        \(\lambda\), denoted \(\vert \lambda \vert\), 
           is the sum of the parts, i.e. the number being partitioned.
	    </p>
		<p>The number of times \(i\) appears as a part in the partition \(\lambda\)
		   is the multiplicity of \(i\) in \(\lambda\) and may be denoted \(m_i(\lambda)\)
           (or simply \(m_i\) if there is no chance of confusion).
		  The multiplicity-superscript representation of a partition is
		  \[ \lambda = \langle 1^{m_1}2^{m_2}3^{m_3}\cdots \rangle, \]
		  where \(m_i\) is often omited if \(m_i=1\) and \(i^{m_i}\) is omited if \(m_i=0\).
        </p>
		<p> Notice that the sequence of multiplicities \( (m_1, m_2, m_3, \dots) \) completely determines
		    any partition \(\lambda\), with
			\[ \ell(\lambda) = \sum_{i \geq 0} m_i(\lambda) \]
			and 
			\[ \vert \lambda \vert = \sum_{i \geq 0} i\, m_i(\lambda). \]
		</p>
		<p> The unique partition of \(0\) is the empty partition \(\emptyset\).  The empty partition
		is the only partition of length zero.</p>
		<p>It is standard to let \(p(n)\) denote the number of partitions of \(n\). The generating
		function for \(p(n)\) was given by Euler:
		\[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n) q^n = \frac{1}{(q;q)_\infty}  = \frac{1}{f(-q)}.\]</p>

	      <h2>Partitions with \(k\) colors</h2>
	    </div>
		<p> An <b>partition with \(k\) colors</b> of an integer \(n\) is a
		    representation of \(n\) as a sum of weakly deceasing positive integers
			where summands of a particular magnitude may occur in \(k\) different distinguishable varieties
			(or colors).  For example, while there are two partitions of \(2\), namely
			\((2)\), and \((1,1)\), there are nine partitions of 2 in three colors:
			\[(2_1), (2_2), (2_3), (1_1, 1_1), (1_1, 1_2), (1_1, 1_3), (1_2, 1_2), (1_2, 1_3), 
			(1_3, 1_3) ,\] where we have distinguished colors 1, 2, and 3 by subscripts.
		</p>
	       <p>
\[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty p^k(n) q^n = \frac{1}{(q;q)^k_\infty}
 = \frac{1}{f(-q)^k}, \] where \(p^k(n)\) denotes the number of \(k\)-colored partitions of \(n\).</p>

      <div class="main_infobox" id="overpartitions">
	    <div class="main_infobox_header">
	      <h2>Overpartitions</h2>
	    </div>
		<p> An <b>overpartition</b> of an integer \(n\) is a
		    representation of \(n\) as a sum of weakly deceasing positive integers
			where the last occurence of any particular positive integer may be optionally distinguished
			with an overline. For example, whereas there are three partitions of \(3\), namely
			\((3), (2,1)\), and \((1,1,1)\), there are eight overpartitions of 3:
			\[(3), (\overline{3}), (2,1), (\overline{2},1), (2,\overline{1}), 
            (\overline{2}, \overline{1}), (1,1,1), (1,1,\overline{1}).\]
		</p>
	       <p>Overpartitions were formally introduced by Corteel and Lovejoy (2004), and
have since accumulated a vast literature.  There are many results related
to partitions that have natural analogs in overpartitions.  
As with partitions, the generating function for the number of overpartitions
\(\overline{p}(n)\) is the reciprocal of a 
<a href="../q-series.html#theta_functions">Ramanujan theta function</a>, specifically,
\[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \overline{p}(n) q^n = \frac{(-q;q)_\infty}{(q;q)_\infty}
 = \frac{1}{\varphi(-q)}. \]</p>
